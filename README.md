# 🎓 SchoolCenter - School Management Platform (React.js)

**SchoolCenter** is a modern web application built with **React.js** for managing a school or educational center. The platform provides both a **public website** for the school and a **private administration dashboard** for internal management.

This project is the foundation of a future **SaaS (Software as a Service)** platform that allows multiple schools to manage their own systems independently and securely.
